## Overview

This document describes the **Applications Import Processing Result** webhook event, where the **Service Provider** subscribes to the `APPLICATIONS_IMPORT_RESULT` event in AccessRC. When the **Program Manager** hits Sync Program for a program that the **Service Provider** is configured for, AccessRC sends a webhook call to the callback service of the Service Provider with the program metadata for integration.
