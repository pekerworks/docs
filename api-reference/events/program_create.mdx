## Overview

This document describes the **Program Created** webhook event, where the **Service Provider** subscribes to the `PROGRAM_CREATED` event in AccessRC. When the **Program Manager** hits Sync Program for a program that the **Service Provider** is configured for, AccessRC sends a webhook call to the callback service of the Service Provider with the program metadata for integration.

## Event Flow: AccessRC → Service Provider

1. **Service Provider** subscribes to the `PROGRAM_CREATED` event.
2. When **Program Manager** hits sync Program, AccessRC sends a webhook call to the service provider's callback URL.
3. The Service Provider processes the metadata of the Program and integrates it into their system.
