Understand general concepts, response codes, and authentication strategies.

## Base URL
The AccessRC API is built on REST principles. We enforce HTTPS in every request to improve data security, integrity, and privacy. The API does not support HTTP.

All requests contain the following base URL:

```http
https://api.accessrc.org/

For testing purposes you can use this URL

```http
https://api.uat.accessrc.org/

##  Authentication

[`Authenticaton`](../../documentation/authentication)

##  Response codes
AccessRC uses standard HTTP codes to indicate the success or failure of your requests.

In general, 2xx HTTP codes correspond to success, 4xx codes are for user-related failures, and 5xx codes are for infrastructure issues.

| Status | Description                                 |
|--------|---------------------------------------------|
| 200    | Successful request.                         |
| 400    | Check that the parameters were correct.     |
| 401    | The API key used was missing or Invalid.    |
| 5xx    | Indicates an error with AccessRC servers.   |

##  Rate limit
The default maximum rate limit is 2 requests per second. This number can be increased for trusted senders by request. After that, youâ€™ll hit the rate limit and receive an error.
