## 🔐 Authentication

Access to the AccessRC API is secured via **API keys**. Each service provider receives a unique API key, which must be included in the header of every request.

### 🛠️ How to Get an API Key

AccessRC platform admin can generate an API key from the **AccessRC Service Provider Portal**:

1. Log into AccessRC Program Managment Module.
2. Select service provider account.
3. Click on the **"Generate API Key"** button (under the "Service Provider" section).
4. Copy and securely store the key. It will be masked in the interface for security.
5. Share the key with Service Provider contact

> ⚠️ Keep your API key secret. Treat it like a password. If compromised, request AccessRC Platform admin to regenerate it from the portal.

### 📥 Using the API Key in Requests

To authenticate, include your API key in the `x-api-key` header of your HTTP requests.

#### Example Header

```http
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
