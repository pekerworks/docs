## Create

Service Provider sends deliverychannels details to AccessRC for registering delivery channels.

[`Create Delivery Channel Request` API endpoint](../../api-reference/endpoint/delivery_channel_create)

<Note>🗒️ Service Provider will track the channel flow with providerDeliveryChannelId (which is the unique identifier of Service Provider delivery channel in its own system) </Note>

## Delivery Channel Approval or Rejection

In the second step of this stage a manual approval will be required by AccessRC IM from the Delivery Channel Screen. After the approval, Service Provider will be notified by `DELIVERY_CHANNEL_STATUS_UPDATED` event. Delivery Channel request can also be rejected and `DELIVERY_CHANNEL_STATUS_UPDATED` event will be sent including a rejection message to Service Provider in that case.
