## Delivery Channel Approval 

In the second step of this stage a manual approval will be required by AccessRC IM from the Delivery Channel Screen. After the approval, Service Provider will be notified by DELIVERY_CHANNEL_STATUS event. Delivery Channel request can also be rejected and DELIVERY_CHANNEL_STATUS event will be sent including a rejection message to Service Provider in that case.
