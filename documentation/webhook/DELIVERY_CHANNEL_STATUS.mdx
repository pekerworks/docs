# Webhook Documentation for Delivery Channel Approval Event

## Overview

This document describes the `DELIVERY_CHANNEL_STATUS` webhook event, triggered after a manual approval or rejection of a delivery channel request within AccessRC. This event is sent from **AccessRC** to the **Service Provider** once the approval decision is made by the Information Management (IM) team from the Registration screen.

---

## Event Flow: AccessRC → Service Provider

1. **Service Provider** submits a delivery channel request.
2. The AccessRC IM team reviews and approves or rejects the request manually.
3. A webhook call is sent to the Service Provider indicating the **status** (`Approved` or `Rejected`) of the delivery channel request.

---

## Webhook Request Payload

The webhook will send one of the following payloads based on the decision.

### ✅ Approved

## Notes
	•	The providerDeliveryChannelId is a required field in both the request and the response.
	•	Ensure your webhook endpoint can correctly distinguish between the statuses and handle them accordingly.
