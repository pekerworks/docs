## ðŸ“¡ Webhook Introduction

Webhooks allow your system to receive real-time updates from AccessRC when specific events happenâ€”such as a delivery channel request approval, a new delivery request or a refund of delivery.

When you subscribe to a webhook event, AccessRC will send an HTTP POST request to your defined URL whenever the event occurs.
