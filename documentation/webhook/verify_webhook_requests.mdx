# Webhook Signing Secret

To verify webhook requests from AccessRC, your service must validate the HMAC-SHA256 signature using a shared secret.

AccessRC platform admin will generate an Shared Secret Key from the **AccessRC Service Provider Portal**:

You will receive this `SHARED_SECRET` during platform admin onboarding your service provider.

> 🔐 **Keep this secret safe and never expose it in logs, URLs, or client-side code.**


## 📬 Signature Header

Every webhook request will include a signature header:

```http
x-accessrc-signature: sha256=3bdc5b07d7ef9b61b98ed5df4b1793e12fd...
```

- The value after `sha256=` is the **hex-encoded HMAC-SHA256 hash**.
- This hash is generated using:
  - The **raw request body**
  - Your **shared secret** (provided during onboarding)

---

## 🔁 Verification Steps

1. **Extract the Signature**
   Read the `X-AccessRC-Signature` header from the incoming webhook request.

2. **Get the Raw Request Body**
   Use the **raw** payload (not the parsed JSON) exactly as received.

3. **Recompute the Signature**
   Use HMAC-SHA256 with your shared secret and the raw body.

4. **Compare Signatures**
   Check if the computed signature matches the one in the header using **constant-time comparison**.

---

## ✅ Example (Pseudocode)

```ts
function verifyWebhookSignature(req, sharedSecret) {
  const receivedSignature = req.headers['x-accessrc-signature']; // e.g. sha256=abcdef...
  const body = req.rawBody; // must be the raw string, before JSON.parse

  const computedSignature = 'sha256=' + HMAC_SHA256(sharedSecret, body);

  return constantTimeCompare(receivedSignature, computedSignature);
}
```

> ⚠️ Ensure you are using the raw request body as a string. Some frameworks (like Express or Django) may parse the body and lose the original formatting.

---

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

- Never log or expose the shared secret.
- Reject unsigned webhook requests.

---

## 📲 Testing Webhooks

To test locally:
- Use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to expose your local webhook endpoint.
- Log the raw body and headers.
- Simulate signature generation using the shared secret.

---

## 📬 Response Expectations

After validation, your endpoint must return a 2xx HTTP status (usually `200 OK`). If validation fails, return `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden`.
